		<p class="epilogue">
			<i>(All answers were corrected after I saw the solutions.) </i><br />
			Apparently, I have 'most' of the class part down; the only real issue I
			had was in 'copying' the conststructor. I wasn't sure how much was copied
			and if I could just tack new arguments in... That part turned into a mess.
			Somewhat proud of the rest, though, and I was closer than I thought I
			would be on Question 4.
			<br />
			<br />
			Thank you for reviewing this! Your time and opinions mean a lot to me.
